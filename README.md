# Requirements
* Repository should have at least three separate _**substantive**_ commits, showing different stages of progress. Each commit should have a useful message.

* Files are organized in a professional way. All publicly visible files, including HTML files, exist in a folder named 'public'. CSS file(s) in a folder named 'css' (i.e., 'public/css'), Javascript files (if any) in a folder named 'js', image files in a folder named 'img', and all other files (if any, e.g., font files) in a folder named 'static'.

* All files have web-appropriate names (no spaces; use dash or underscore), and appropriate extensions (\*.htm, \*.html, \*.css, etc.)

* Three separate HTML pages, including 'index'. Home page named 'index.htm' or 'index.html'

* All pages have a common nav bar (on the top or left) that links the three pages. Pages use the same base style sheet(s), and have a common feel.

* One page shows user information (may be fake), showing name, country or origin, birthdate, age, email address (clickable `mailto:` link that opens an email browser!), and a (fake) profile picture of the (fake) user. See https://randomuser.me for examples.

* One page includes a table of books. Table should have at the following columns (title, author(s), year published, publisher, page count, MSRP) and four rows.

* On the same page as your table of data, include a `<form>`suitable for adding rows to the table. (It doesn't need to *do* anything yet.) Include one input element for each column. Use the appropriate input type. Format the form using an appropriate Bootstrap recipe.

* Use Bootstrap (>= v4) on all pages. On all pages, also include a custom style sheet that overrides *at least* the following Bootstrap defaults: background color, text color, header color, link color.

* In your custom CSS file, also write at least one declaration for an element by CSS class and one declaration for an element by id. Use those elements in your pages.

* The pages should include at least two images (overall). Show the image thumbnails on the page. Link the thumbnails to larger versions of the same images. Include citation or attribution for each image. (This is _**not**_ `alt` text, and should be visible to anyone viewing the page.)
